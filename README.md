# Reinforcement Learning Transformers

A comprehensive PyTorch implementation of various reinforcement learning algorithms for solving classic control environments. This project demonstrates different approaches to reinforcement learning, from classic Deep Q-Networks to modern Actor-Critic methods, with support for LunarLander-v3 environment.

## üéØ Overview

This project showcases multiple reinforcement learning algorithms trained on classic environments from OpenAI Gymnasium. The algorithms can learn to:
- **LunarLander-v3**: Land a spacecraft on the moon by controlling thrusters and orientation to maximize cumulative reward

## üéÆ Usage

### Quick Start

Train all algorithms (DQN, Policy Gradient, Actor-Critic) with default settings:
```bash
python simulate.py
```

### Custom Training

```python
import gymnasium as gym
from network import Feedforward
from runner import DQNRunner
import torch

# Create environment
env = gym.make("LunarLander-v3", render_mode="rgb_array")
device = torch.device("mps" if torch.backends.mps.is_available() else "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Initialize model and optimizer
net = Feedforward(state_dim=env.observation_space.shape[0], action_dim=env.action_space.n, 
                  hidden_dims=[256, 256, 128])
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(net.parameters(), lr=1e-3)

# Create runner and train
runner = DQNRunner(env, net, optimizer, device, batch_size=64, 
                   epsilon_start=1.0, epsilon_end=0.01, epsilon_decay=0.995)
runner.run(n_episodes=200000, max_steps=200000)

# Generate demo
runner.play_and_save_gif(title="My Custom Agent", filename="my_demo.gif")
```

## üß† Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Deep Q-Network (DQN)
- **Type**: Value-based
- **Key Features**: Experience replay, target network, epsilon-greedy exploration
- **Architecture**: Configurable Feedforward network (default: 256-256-128-output)
- **Best For**: Discrete action spaces, stable learning

### 2. Actor-Critic
- **Type**: Actor-Critic
- **Key Features**: Separate actor and critic networks, advantage estimation
- **Architecture**: Independent Feedforward networks for actor and critic
- **Best For**: Continuous and discrete actions, sample efficiency

### 3. Policy Gradient (REINFORCE)
- **Type**: Policy-based
- **Key Features**: Direct policy optimization, baseline subtraction
- **Architecture**: Feedforward network with softmax output
- **Best For**: Policy optimization, on-policy learning

## üìä Performance Metrics

| Algorithm | Avg Reward | Episodes to Solve | Sample Efficiency |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| DQN | ~200+ | 100-300 | Medium |
| Actor-Critic | ~200+ | 50-200 | High |
| Policy Gradient | ~150+ | 200-500 | Low |

*Results may vary based on hyperparameters and random seeds. LunarLander-v3 is considered solved at 200+ average reward.*
